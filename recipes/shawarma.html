    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch single crust pie</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons margarine</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 potato, diced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen green peas</li>
        <li>2 cups cubed cooked or leftover beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 
            <br> On a lightly floured surface, roll the pie crust out into a 12 inch circle. 
            <br> Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Melt margarine in a saucepan over medium heat. 
            <br> Add potato and onion, and cook until the onion is tender, but not brown. 
            <br> Sprinkle the flour over the mixture, and stir to blend. <br> 
            Season with oregano, black pepper and garlic powder. <br> Pour in the beef broth, and add the peas, carrot and beef. <br> Bring to a boil. Transfer the mixture to a 2 quart casserole dish, <br> and place the pastry over the top. <br> Cut slits for steam, and flute the edges.</li>
        <li>Place on a baking sheet, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, <br>
             or until crust is golden. Let stand 10 minutes before serving to thicken.</li>
    </ol>
